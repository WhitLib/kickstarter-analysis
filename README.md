## 1 Purpose 

This analysis was conducted to assist a playwright, Louise, who is interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. Prior to this analysis, Louise had already estimated a budget of over $10000. Throughout this project, Excel was used to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a fundraising campaign successful. Using insights derived from Excel will allow Louise to gain insight on how to plan her own campaign and set it up for success. Most importantly, Louise will be able to understand campaigns from start to finish and will be able to mirror her own fundraising effort after other successful campaigns within the same category.
